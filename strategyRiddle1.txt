STRATEGY RIDDLE 1 

You can choose two different strategies.

STRATEGY 1: 

The strategy to win this game and be freed by the aliens is to agree that the tallest agent says:

 - Blue to indicate that he sees an odd number of red hats in front of him.
 - Red to indicate that he sees an even number of red hats in front of him.

ALl other agents can infer their hat colors based on this announcement. 

STRATEGY 2:

The first agent, the tallest one, should say 'blue' if he sees n-1 red hats, and 'pass' otherwise. Each agent thereafter should say 'red' if some agent before him made a guess, 'blueÂ´ if all the agents who declared before him passed and he sees nothing but red hats in front of him, and
'pass' otherwise. The agents are assured survival as a group in every possible arrangement of colored hats except one: when all hats are red.
