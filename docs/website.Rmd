In this website we present an analysis of the riddle "Prisoners and Hats". This website contains the following sections:


# Description of the riddle

You and other individuals have been captured by super-intelligent aliens! The aliens think humans look quite tasty, but luckily for you, their civilization forbids eating highly logical and cooperative beings. Theyâ€™re not sure whether you qualify, so they decide to give you all a test. 
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '20%'}
knitr::include_graphics("alien.png")
```

# Implementation

```{r eruptions, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```
