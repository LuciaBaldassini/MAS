## Description of the riddle 


<font face="apple chancery" color="olive"><center><i>You and other individuals have been captured by super-intelligent aliens! The aliens think agents look quite tasty, but luckily for you, their civilization forbids eating highly logical and cooperative beings. They are not sure whether you qualify, so they decide to give you all a test to figure that out. 
The aliens tell you the following:</i> </center></font>


<p><center> "You will be placed in a line, facing forward and ordered from <i>tallest</i> to <i>shortest</i>. You will not be able to look behind you or step out of line. <br>
Each of you will have either a <span style="color:blue">blue</span> or a <span style="color: red">red</span> hat, assigned randomly and no one will be told how many of each colour there are. When I tell you to begin, each of you must guess the colour of your hat, starting from the person in the back and moving down the line.
Don't even think to say words other than <span style="color:blue">blue</span> or <span style="color: red">red</span> or signal something with intonation for instance. <br><i><b>Else, you will all be eaten immediately! </b></i> 
<br>If at least the total number of you minus 1 guess the colour correctly, you will be spared. You are given a couple of minutes to discuss a strategy before we start!"</center></p>


<!--<font color="olive"><center><i>Can you think of a strategy guaranteed to save everyone?</i> </center></font>
-->

### Strategy

The strategy to win this game and be freed by the aliens is to agree that whichever individual has to give an answer, says:
<ul>
<li> <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> to indicate that he sees an odd number of <span style="color:red">red</span> hats in front of him.</li>
<li><span style="color:red">Red</span> to indicate that he sees an even number of <span style="color:red">red</span> hats in front of him. </li>
</ul>
As all agents are trustworthy, each agent can fully rely on the fact that each agent applies the strategy accordingly (and thus, honestly). <br>

Since the tallest agents does not hear any information from another agent before he has to speak, he cannot be entirely sure about his hat colour. Therefore, the first agent to answer (i.e. the tallest) has a large chance of guessing his hat color incorrectly. However, this is not a big problem, since the aliens allowed the agents to make one mistake as a group in total. All other agents can say with full certainty which colour their hat is. Hence, there will not be made more than 1 mistake by the group. Namely, on the basis of hearing the previous answer(s) and seeing the hats in front of him, each agent can update his private knowledge and determine his own hat colour. 

The game's goal is to have as many of the agents correctly guess their hat colour. The game is successfully played if the number of hats minus 1, is collectively reached. Therefore, using the technique mentioned above, the game is always played successfully, since only the tallest agent is unsure.

<!--When the first agent has answered, the common knowledge of the others gets immediately adjusted. The number of possible worlds decrements when the previous agent(s) has indicated whether he sees an odd or even number of blue hats in front of him. Combining previous answers with an agent's current..

## Implementation

To solve the riddle we built a system that is run from the command line. At the beginning, the system will ask the user whether (s)he would like to read the descirption of the riddle or not. Next, the user can select the amount of agents and whether or not to assign a hat colour for each agent. In case the user does not want to manually input a hat colour, these will be assigned randomly. The system will then show a table containing each agent, their hat colour and how many <span style="color:red">red</span> and <span style="color:blue">blue</span> hats each agent see. Throughout the programme, we adopt the convention that the tallest agent is represented by the agent with the highest number and the shortest agent is represented by the agent with the lowest number. 

Each agent is created from a class ```Agent()``` which stored the agent number, the colour of the hat and the number of hats in front of him. The main programme contains the dialogues with the user and a several functions. The function ```assignRandomHat``` and ```assignUserHat``` assign a random hat colour or the colour input by the user, respectively. The function ```showHatDistribution``` can be called to print the distiributions of the hats among the agents. Lastly, the function ```countHat``` counts, for each agent, the amount of blue and red hats seen by the agents. 


A programme that solves this riddle can be found [here](https://github.com/LuciaBaldassini/MAS).

## Analysis

Depending on the number of agents and the hat colours assigned to each of them, there are multiple different scenarios possible. 
As an example, we will elaborate on the possible worlds in which three agents are participating in total. Each of the agents is either wearing a <span style="color: red">red</span> or <span style="color:blue">blue</span> hat.The following table indicates the 8 different scenarios that are possible in this situation. The arrows visualize the direction the particular agent is looking at and the color of the cell represents the agent's hat colour.

### Example Analysis Scenario 4
In order to analyze the problem, we will present an example and go through all the agents' announcements and the changes to the Kripke model. This way, we can explore how the knowledge of the agents change. 

In our example, <span style="color:#00FF00">Agent 1</span> (the smallest agent) will be wearing a <span style="color:blue">blue</span> hat. <span style="color:#FF8000">Agent 2</span> (the middle agent) will also be wearing a <span style="color:blue">blue</span> hat. <span style="color:#007FFF">Agent 3</span> (the tallest agent) will be wearing a <span style="color:red">red</span> hat. 

```{r prisoners, echo=FALSE, out.width = '30%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/Prisoners_rbb.png")
```

Initially, we could draw the following Kripke model: 

```{r model no relations, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/hats_rbb_agent3,2,1.png")
```

Firstly, <span style="color:#007FFF">Agent 3</span> will announce <span style="color:red">red</span> to indicate that he sees an even number of <span style="color:red">red</span> hats (namely, 0). Both <span style="color:#FF8000">Agent 2</span> and <span style="color:#00FF00">Agent 1</span> now know this information. Hence, the Kripke model is updated to: 


```{r model after 3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/hats_rbb_after3.png")
```

<span style="color:#FF8000">Agent 2</span> now knows that the real world is either &#60;r,b,b&#62; or &#60;b,b,b&#62; but it at least knows for sure the colour of its hat is <span style="color:blue">blue</span> and announces this. Because of this announcement, <span style="color:#00FF00">Agent 1</span> now has to update the knowledge that there is an even number of <span style="color:red">red</span> hats to the fact that the remaining hats now include an odd number of <span style="color:red">red</span> hats. The Kripke model is updated to: 

```{r model after 3 and 2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/hats_rbb_after3,2.png")
```

Just like <span style="color:#FF8000">Agent 2</span>, <span style="color:#00FF00">Agent 1</span> now knows that the real world is either &#60;r,b,b&#62; or &#60;b,b,b&#62;. Therefore, <span style="color:#00FF00">Agent 1</span> can conclude that the colour of its own hat is <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, solving the riddle.
