STRATEGY RIDDLE 2

The winning strategy is called the “checksum modulo-3” method. The prisoners agree on different numbers to represent each colour hat, for example: yellow = 0, blue = 1 and red = 2. Using these numbers, the tallest agents add up the numbers of the colour he or she sees and performs a modulo of 3 on the sum, therefore obtaining either number 0, 1 or 2 and he or she will then utter the corresponding colour. In order to avoid negative numbers, all agents start with a tally of 30 and add the number corresponding to the colour uttered by the tallest agent to what is called the “running tally”. The next agent also calculates the sum of the hats in front of him or her, and subtracts this number from the running tally and then performs a modulo of 3, such that they end up with their own colour hat. The next agents again subtract this number from the current running tally such that when it is their turn, they all correctly call out the colour of their hat.
